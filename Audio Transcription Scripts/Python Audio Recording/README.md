# Audio Recording Script

This script captures audio from the system's loopback device using WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) and processes it to remove silent segments. The processed audio is then saved in the specified directory.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - `pyaudio`
  - `pydub`
  - `wave`
  - `dotenv`

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pyaudio pydub python-dotenv
```

## How the Script Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Loads environment variables using `dotenv` to specify the save folder for recordings.
   - Ensures the save directory exists, and prepares filenames with timestamps.

2. **Audio Recording**:
   - Uses `pyaudio` to identify and access the WASAPI loopback device.
   - Opens an audio stream and records audio data in 24-bit PCM format with a chunk size of 512 frames.
   - Supports pausing and resuming recording via user input (`PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `STOP`).

3. **Processing the Audio**:
   - Loads the recorded WAV file using `pydub`.
   - Detects silent segments and combines non-silent segments into a new audio file.
   - Saves the processed audio with the same audio format settings as the original recording.

## How to Use the Script

1. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the same directory as the script:
   ```dotenv
   RECORDER_SAVE_FOLDER=path/to/save/folder
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Use the following commands to control the recording:
   - `PAUSE`: Pauses the recording.
   - `RESUME`: Resumes the recording.
   - `STOP`: Stops the recording.

## Potential Improvements

While the script achieves its primary goal, there are several areas that could be improved:

1. **Error Handling**:
   - The script does not handle certain types of errors effectively, such as device unavailability, permission issues, or file write errors. Adding comprehensive error handling will make the script more robust.
   - Consider using exception handling around `pyaudio` stream operations and `wave` file writing to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

2. **Input and Output Device Selection**:
   - Currently, the script selects the default output device. Adding functionality to list all available input/output devices and allowing the user to choose would increase flexibility.
   - This can be achieved using `pyaudio.PyAudio.get_device_info_by_index()` to list all devices and implementing a selection prompt.

3. **Output Format and Quality**:
   - The output settings (e.g., sample rate, bit depth, channels) are currently hardcoded. Introducing configurable parameters would allow users to adjust recording settings based on their requirements.

4. **Silence Detection Parameters**:
   - The `detect_silence` function uses fixed thresholds (`min_silence_len=500`, `silence_thresh=-40`). Making these parameters adjustable through environment variables or user input will improve adaptability to different environments and recording conditions.

5. **Memory and Resource Management**:
   - Currently, garbage collection is forced when data size exceeds 50 MB. This threshold could be refined, and it may be worth monitoring memory usage more dynamically.
   - Consider using a context manager to ensure resources are always released, even in the event of unexpected errors.

6. **User Feedback and Logging**:
   - The script relies on print statements for status updates, which can be missed in certain environments. Introducing logging with different log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) would provide better insights into the script's operation and make debugging easier.

7. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - The script is designed specifically for Windows (WASAPI). Adding support for other platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS) by detecting the operating system and using appropriate libraries would make it more versatile.

## Known Issues

- The script may not function correctly if the loopback device is not available or enabled. Ensure that loopback recording is supported and enabled on your system.
- When the script is stopped, there may be a slight delay in closing the stream. This can be optimized with more efficient resource handling.

## Disclaimer

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the audio devices on your system.
- The script is intended for personal or development use. Always comply with local regulations and organizational policies regarding recording and data storage.
